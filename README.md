### Testing User Stories

### Further Testing

### Found Bugs

- While deploying early to heroku: 
    1. Build failed:
        -   `git push heroku main` failed when running `python manage.py collectstatic --noinput` with *No such file or directory: '/tmp/build_643c5311/static'*    
        -   caused by Git not storing empty directories, and heroku does not automatically create the target directory that `collectstatic` uses. Solution found on [heroku documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets)
        -   solution was to include a dummy file to make git create the folder. After that the heroku build process passed, and the deployment was a success. 
    1. Static files missing:
        -   self hosted static files are not supported on heroku, as stated [in the documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-assets#whitenoise)
        -   the documentation draws attention to a project called [whitenoise](http://whitenoise.evans.io/en/stable/) that can integrate into Django applications, and were designed for this purpose. This solution been chosen for early deployment and testing.

## Deployment
<a href="#table-of-content">Go back <span style="font-size: 1.3em">üîù</span></a>

The project was deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.

-   Steps for deployment:
    -   Fork or clone this repository
    -   Create a new Heroku app
    -   In the app settings:
        -   Add a config var of `PORT`:`8000`
        -   Set the buildpacks to `Python` and `NodeJS` in that order
    -   Link the Heroku app to the forked repository
    -   Manually **Deploy**

### Making a Local Clone

> *Review* to make the whole project locally deployable
Requires Python 3 installed in local environment, to run the game in a terminal

-   Fork or clone this repository
-   Navigate to folder in a terminal
-   Run the following command `python3 manage.py runserver`
