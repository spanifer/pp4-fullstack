## Design Process

-   ### Application Aim
    The site aims to be the main bridge between the client and the agency.

    From the agency standpoint, it mainly helps the agency's work by alleviating the manual creation of customer data and scheduling meetings according to staff availability.

    Customers looking to rent or to let provide valuable information on the services offered. Each client must register to have access to the site features, and for ease of access, registrations are built-in while requesting an appointment.

    Customers looking to rent a property can browse through the available properties. In addition, each booked appointment for a property is available in the client's dashboard, where they can book, amend, or cancel a meeting.
